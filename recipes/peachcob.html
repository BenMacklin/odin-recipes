    Southern Peach Cobbler
    </h1>
  <img class="braise4"src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F43%2F2022%2F07%2F07%2F51535-fresh-southern-peach-cobbler-ddmfs-0653-1x1-1.jpg" alt="Lets get cooking">

<p>A cobbler — not to be confused with a crisp or crumble — is a deep-dish fruit dessert with a sweetened fruit filling that is topped off with a biscuit-like dough. The dough may cover the entire dish or be dropped by the spoonful, earning it the name "cobbler" for its resemblance to a cobblestone street. It gives you the same fruit-and-pastry combination as pie, but without all the effort.

In the case of peach cobbler, fresh, frozen, or canned peaches may be combined with sugar, spices, lemon juice, and cornstarch (for thickening). As with all cobblers, it's finished off with a biscuit-like topping and sprinkled with a cinnamon-sugar mixture.
